* product tolerance
let
i1 = (x1 * (1 - p1), x1 * (1 + p1))
i2 = (x2 * (1 - p2), x2 * (1 + p2))
then
i1 * i2
= (x1 * x2 * (1 - p1 - p2 + p1 * p2), x1 * x2 * (1 + p1 + p2 + p1 * p2))
~= (x1 * x2 * (1 - p1 - p2), x1 * x2 * (1 + p1 + p2))
i.e. tolerance of the product is the sum of the tolerances of the factors
